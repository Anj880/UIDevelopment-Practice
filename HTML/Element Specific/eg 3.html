          Women's empowerment (or female empowerment) may be defined in several ways, including accepting women's viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, and training.[1][2][3] Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different societal problems.[4] They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals
